# Time-Series-Forecasting-Workflow-in-R

Forecast time series data of various types (simple/multiple time series, cross section data with time series components, time series with irregular intervals)

1. First, handling various time object data with library(xts) and library(lubridate)
2. EDA of time series data with autoplot, ggplot2 and plotly
3. Decomposition using Seasonality-Trend-Cycle framework
4. Data transformation
5. Modeling:
  - Simple smoothing
  - Exponential Smoothing
  - ARIMA 
  - GARCH
  - Facebook's prophet
  - RNN
  - Machine Learning models
  
I will showcase two datasets from Kaggle competitions I participated: M5 Forecasting and Energy Prediction.
